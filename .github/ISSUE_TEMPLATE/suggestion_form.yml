        ### Currently Taking a Break from Suggestions
        Hi there! Thank you for wanting to share your ideas. ðŸ˜Š  
        At the moment, I don't have the capacity to review new suggestions. However, I really value your input and hope to revisit this in the future.  
        Feel free to check back later when suggestions are open again!
